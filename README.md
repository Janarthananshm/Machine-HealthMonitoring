# Machine-HealthMonitoring
 The proposed System analyses the condition and working of the machine along with the prediction of the lifetime of the machinery,
 thus, providing an upperhand in the automated world. The lifetime forecasting is done by implementing predictve analysis which 
 uses linear regression algorithms consisting of vibration, temperature and humidity data gathered through suitable vibration 
 and temperature sensors.
